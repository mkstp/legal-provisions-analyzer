# Summary
This toolkit helps to semantically compare statements between First Nation treaties. It parses pdfs of individual treaties, then clusters then formats their provisions together into a searchable csv file. This is useful for quickly determining which treaties have language on certain topics, and how successive treaties have evolved their interpretation and discussion of these topics.
